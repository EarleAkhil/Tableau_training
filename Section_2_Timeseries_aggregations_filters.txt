Now we are using Year(period) which is data type of date in the column section and then unemployed data field in the
row section.

Analysis question: Here we can see that the data in the unemployed section got summed up for the entire year 2007 irrespective age,gender.
Hence we can see that 
1. In 2005, the number of unemployed is 18,621,000.
2. In 2006, enmployed is 15,523,000
So, We can see that highest unemployed is in year 2010 and  unemployed people are 78,130,000 and 
So, We can see that lowest unemployed is in year 2015 and  unemployed people are 5,849,000

Aggregation means summing up

What is granularity?
The more detailed, the higher the granularity.(Hence the more rows of data you will have)
The less detailed, the lower the granularity.(Vice versa, the less number of rows of data you will have).

Now, we are working with time series
What is dimension,measure and category in tableau for time series


Tableau treats any field containing numeric (quantitative) information as a measure.
eg: sales is a measure and it is also dependent variable.

a dimension is a field that can be considered an independent variable. 
By default, Tableau treats any field containing qualitative, categorical information as a dimension.

What is aggregation and granularity.

Here month(of period) shows granularity because it sums up all the data for the months

measures which are quantitative fields will specify the aggregation
while dimensions  which are qualitative or categorical will specify the granularity. 

Data preparation is the process of getting well formatted data into a single table or multiple related tables so it can be analyzed in Tableau.
data cleanliness, such correct data types and correct data values.

color coded: blue fields are discrete and green fields are continuous).

Aggregation

refers to how multiple data values are brought together into a single value, 
such as counting all the Google searches for Pumpkin Spice or 
taking the average of all the temperature readings around Seattle on a given day.

By default, measures in Tableau are always aggregated. 
The default aggregation is SUM. You can change the aggregation to options like Average, Median, Count Distinct, Minimum, etc.

Granualarity
refers to how detailed the data is. What does a row or record in the data set represent? 
A person with malaria? A provinces' total cases of malaria for the month? That's the granularity.

Knowing the granularity of the data is crucial to working with level of detail (LOD) expressions.

now: we are creating an area chart.

Data analysis: Here in the chart we can see the unemployment in U.S in between 2005 and 2015.
So, it is the median of the unemployment and granularity level is gender plus age.
So that it means for every month there is several age groups, seven age groups, times two genders.
so, for every month there will be 14 observations
age 
male
female
month - jan
age 16-19
20-24
25-34
35-44
45-54
55-64
65 and above

Highlighting concept in tableau.
Now we are making our chart back to line chart.
Now we are taking age field and drag in colour

So, we can check that in the area chart, we can see the pop-up for instance 20 to 24 years age the unemployement rate is 9.6M
So, from the area chart, we can do our analysis that
for age 16 -19 , the hightest unemployment is in the 2010,period of april and sum is 414,000 and  the lowest was  in january.2005 129,000
for age 20 -24 , the hightest unemployment is in the april 2010,period of april and sum is 967,000 and  the lowest was in january 265,000
for age 25 -34 , the hightest unemployment is in the period of 2010,april and sum is 1.5 M and  the lowest was in january,2005 336,000
for age 35 -44 , the hightest unemployment is in the period of 2010,april and sum is 1.3 M and  the lowest was in january,2005 381,000
for age 45 -54 , the hightest unemployment is in the period of 2010,april and sum is 1.3 M and  the lowest was in january,2005 364,000
for age 55 -64 , the hightest unemployment is in the period of 2010,nov and sum is 1.5 M and  the lowest was in january,2005 364,000
for age 65 and above , the hightest unemployment is in the period of september,2011 and sum is 940,000 and  the lowest was in january,2005 115,000

Now, to make the chart to look more pretty, we are adding the labels.
Today, I had learned about the area chart and highlighting concept.

Today, we are going to discuss about filters topic which is very important lecture today.

As we can see in the area chart unemployment data, age but the field gender is missing. So, want to add this to our chart.
To do this , we will add gender to our filter tab.

Now we are going to learn what is quick filter.It is a helpful feature which is used to quickly analyze the data.
